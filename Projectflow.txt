1. Creating git repo and cloning it to local
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it (will save csv file to new "data" folder)
3. git commit push
4. pip install dvc
5. just like git init, we should "dvc init" first
6. "mkdir S3" - create a new directory named S3 #just for the feel of it. it could be real data from S3
7. we need to tell DVC our origin i.e "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" just like we do with git.
    if we were using S3 service, the syntax would have been "dvc remote add -d <name> <"URL_OF_S3-Storage">"
8. Next we can use "dvc add data/" -> the data or csv file in the mentioned directory (data\), dvc will be now responsible for the versioning of the files.
    (it will ask to remove the git tracking permissions, we can do ("git rm -r --cached 'data' and "git commit -m "stopped tracking data")
    because initially we were tracking with git and now we remove it for DVC to handle.
9. Again do the step 8 i.e "dvc add data/" then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
10. now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
11. git commit push and mark as first version of it.
